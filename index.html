        <h4 id="im">Why people Migrate</h4>
        <p id="p3"><b>Most people migrate for economic reasons. People think about emigrating from places that have few job opportunities, and they immigrate to places where jobs seem to be available. Because of economic restructuring, job prospects often vary from one country to another and within regions of the same country. 
            Many people leave their home countries in order to look for economic opportunities in another country. Others migrate to be with family members who have migrated or because of political conditions in their countries. Education is another reason for international migration, as students pursue their studies abroad. </b></p>

        <h3>What is EMIGRATION</h3>
      <p id="p4">
        Emigration is the act of leaving a resident country or place of residence with the intent to settle elsewhere. Conversely, immigration describes the movement of people into one country from another. Hence one might emigrate from one's native country to immigrate to another country.
